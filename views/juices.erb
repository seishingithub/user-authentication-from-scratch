      <p>Try our all-NEW Spring Cleanse delivered to your door!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="resetColumnSet"></div>

    <p class="nav_body">Our juices are 100% raw (unpasteurized) and cold pressed using a state-of-the-art
      hydraulic press which preserves the greatest amount of nutrients, antioxidants and
      enzymes. Every 16 oz. bottle of juice is made with love and packed with approximately
      3 lbs. of fresh organic fruits and veggies. Then they are air-sealed in 100% BPA-free
      bottles in order to keep them fresh and pure for you (guaranteed to stay fresh for at
      least 5 days including the day of delivery). We rush deliver the juices straight to your
      door the same day they are pressed fresh for a fixed $25 fee for as many juices as you order.
      While 5 days is recommended for optimum freshness and potency, several of our juices may
      remain perfectly delicious and nutritious after 5 days. But please note that while
      many of our juices remain fresh past 5 days, we cannot guarantee their freshness and
      potency after 5 days. Delivery times are between 6:15pm-9:45pm on your selected delivery
      day (selected at checkout).</p>
